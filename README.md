## Doctor Authentication
Ayurvedic Doctor Verification & Auth Platform  
This project provides the front-end components for a secure authentication and verification system designed for an Ayurvedic medicine platform in India. Ensuring that every practitioner is genuine, qualified, and trustworthy is a critical safety issue. This web application addresses this by providing a clear, multi-layered verification process and a user-friendly interface for doctors to register and log in.

### Project Purpose
The primary goal is to build trust and safety between patients and Ayurvedic doctors. By creating a transparent and robust verification system, the platform can ensure the credibility of its registered practitioners, protecting users from fraudulent or unqualified individuals.

### Features
1. Comprehensive Verification Flow Page (Doctor-auth.html)  
   A detailed informational page that transparently communicates the entire verification process to potential applicants and users.

   - Multi-Tiered Approach: Breaks down the process into three distinct tiers:
     - Tier 1: Mandatory Document Submission (BAMS Degree, Council Registration, etc.).
     - Tier 2: Digital & Manual Verification (Database checks, QR code scanning).
     - Tier 3: Personal & Professional Confirmation (Video KYC, Reference Checks).
   - Ongoing Monitoring: Explains how the platform maintains trust through "Verified" badges, patient feedback, and periodic re-verification.
   - Professional Design: Clean, responsive, and easy-to-understand layout.

2. Doctor Authentication Page (Doctor-auth.html)  
   A sleek, modern, and interactive page for doctor authentication.

   - Unified Interface: A single page handles both Login and Registration for a seamless user experience.
   - Interactive Form Switching: Features a smooth 3D flip animation to toggle between the login and registration forms.
   - Doctor-Centric Fields: The registration form is specifically designed to capture essential information like the NCISM/State Council Registration Number from the start.
   - Responsive Design: Fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Future Scope
This project currently covers the front-end components. Future development would involve:
- Backend Integration: Building a server-side application (e.g., using Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails) to handle user registration, login logic, and secure data processing.
- Database Connection: Integrating a database (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase Firestore) to store and manage doctor profiles, documents, and verification statuses.
- Secure Document Uploads: Implementing a secure file storage solution (like AWS S3 or Cloudinary) for doctors to upload their verification documents.
- API Integration: Connecting to official medical council databases to automate parts of the verification process.
- Dashboard Development: Creating a full-featured dashboard for verified doctors to manage their profiles, appointments, and patient interactions.
